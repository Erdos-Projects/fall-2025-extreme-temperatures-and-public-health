Health and weather data for UK regions from 1981 - 2022.

Directories/files included:

Data/HealthData - The health data we will primarily use is in HealthData/Weekly_deaths_by_age_and_region_1981_2022

Data/labelled_regions_map.png  - shows the UK regions we are considering in this study. Note that although Scotland is truncated and labelled on the map, it is not included in our statistics. 

Data/PopulationStatistics - Populations for different local authorities by year since 1981. The regions we are looking at are made up of groups of these 'local authorities', so we need to sum the population in each local authority to get the region's population each year.

Project linking health and weather data for ten UK regions from 1981 - 2022.

This project will analyse weekly mortality data from England and Wales (1981â€“2020) alongside historical weather records to explore correlations between extreme weather events and public health outcomes. By adjusting for regional population changes and combining health data with temperature, precipitation, and humidity trends, we assess the short-term and long-term impacts of weather on mortality. Our findings will help stakeholders, such as health services and policymakers, improve preparedness, target vulnerable groups, and inform cost-benefit analyses of public health interventions.
